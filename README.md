# IWP-Project-final
This is for our IWP project

This project is a continuation of our DBMS project. We have improved the look of the website, added more bootstrap and we have also added an algorithm which can be used to tell the manager how much time it might take for the people int the queue to be seated.


The goal of this project is to manage a restaurant database. Over the course of this project we are 
going to create a website that will make it easier for consumers to order and for waiters to serve. To collect 
and extract data records, we will employ the concept of a relational database management system. The 
goal of the project is to ensure that a restaurant runs well during peak rush hours. This will speed up the 
delivery of meals from the kitchen to the customersâ€™ tables. To implement the above idea we have used 
HTML, MySQL, TAILBLOCKS FLASK, etc.
